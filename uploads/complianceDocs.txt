Summary of "Regulatory & Legislative Update: What Employers Need to Know in 2024"
The document provides a comprehensive overview of key regulatory and legislative updates that employers must consider to ensure compliance in the administration of employee benefits plans in 2024. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to fiduciary responsibilities and highlights recent legislative changes that impact welfare plans and health coverage offerings.

Introduction to Compliance and Fiduciary Duties
The document underscores that maintaining compliant benefits plans is essential not only for meeting legal requirements but also for safeguarding employee rights and organizational investments. The focus on fiduciary responsibility has intensified, making it imperative for employers to manage welfare plans diligently.

Fiduciary duties are categorized into two types: named fiduciaries (officially listed in the plan) and functional fiduciaries (those who exercise authority over the plan). These duties include managing risk, monitoring fees, adhering to plan documents, and providing accurate information to participants. Failure to meet these obligations can result in penalties and enforcement actions.

Key Regulatory Updates for 2024
Several updates in federal regulations directly impact employee benefits plans:

1. ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act)
ERISA sets minimum standards for retirement and welfare benefit plans, ensuring the protection of plan participants. The document details the types of plans covered under ERISA and those exempt, such as government and church plans.

2. The No Gag Clause Rule
The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 introduced the "No Gag Clause Rule," which mandates that agreements with insurers and healthcare providers must not restrict the sharing of health plan cost and quality information. Employers must annually attest their compliance with this rule through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

3. Prescription Drug and Medical Reporting
Employers must submit annual reports on healthcare and drug spending via the RxDC module in HIOS. This reporting applies to all health plans, including insured and self-funded plans, and is due by June 1 each year.

4. Transparency in Coverage Regulations
Since July 2022, health plans have been required to post machine-readable files (MRFs) detailing in-network rates and out-of-network costs for medical and prescription drugs. The document highlights that by 2024, price comparisons must be made available for all shoppable services.

5. Mental Health Parity Act & Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA)
The MHPAEA requires that mental health and substance use disorder services receive the same financial and treatment limits as medical services. Employers must maintain a comparative analysis demonstrating parity and submit it upon request to relevant authorities.

Year-End Compliance To-Dos
The document outlines critical year-end tasks for employers to avoid penalties:

Employer Shared Responsibility: Applicable to employers with 50+ employees, this provision under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires offering affordable health coverage. The document provides details on IRS reporting forms and deadlines for compliance.

Annual Notice Obligations: Employers must distribute various notices, including the Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act Notice and Medicare Part D Creditable Coverage Disclosure, to relevant parties each year.

EEOC Reporting: Employers with 15+ employees must display the "Know Your Rights" poster to comply with EEOC requirements. Additionally, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), effective June 27, 2023, requires updates to workplace materials.

Lingering COVID Issues: While COVID-19 vaccines remain an ACA preventive service, only in-network first-dollar coverage is mandated following the end of the public health emergency. COVID testing is no longer required as a preventive service.

Paid Family and Medical Leave Laws: The document lists states that have enacted paid leave laws, with new provisions taking effect in Minnesota (2024) and Maine (2026). It also highlights states allowing voluntary paid leave programs and the sale of paid family leave insurance.

2024 Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA) and Other Changes
The guide outlines key COLA updates for 2024:

Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA): The FSA cap increases to $3,200 in 2024.
Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefits: Limits for commuter and parking expenses rise to $315 monthly.
Health Savings Accounts (HSA): Annual contribution limits for individual and family coverage increase.
Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangements (QSEHRAs): Payment limits rise to $6,150 for individual coverage and $12,450 for family coverage.
The document also mentions potential legislative changes, such as increased transparency for Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and expanded ACA preventive services. However, these changes remain uncertain.
